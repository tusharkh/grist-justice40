# Grist Justice40 Analysis

In this repo, I attempt to recreate the analysis from the Grist article [*The White House excluded race from its environmental justice tool. We put it back in.*](https://grist.org/equity/climate-and-economic-justice-screening-tool-race/) by 
[Naveena Sadasivam](https://grist.org/author/naveena-sadasivam/) & [Clayton Aldern](https://grist.org/author/clayton-aldern/). Just getting some practice playing with census data and putting together nice visualizations.
